# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning

In today's class, you'll get an introduction to neural networks. You'll gain an understanding of neural networks and how they work. You'll also learn how to use the TensorFlow and Keras Python libraries to fit a basic neural network and make predictions.


By the end of this class, you will be able to:

Describe a neural network model and its components.
Preprocess data for neural network models.
Implement neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Save trained TensorFlow neural network models for later use.
Compare neural network models and deep neural network models.
Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Apply encoding techniques to categorical variables.
Build deep neural network models for binary and multi-class problems.
