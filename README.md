# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning

In today's class, you'll get an introduction to neural networks. You'll gain an understanding of neural networks and how they work. You'll also learn how to use the TensorFlow and Keras Python libraries to fit a basic neural network and make predictions.


By the end of this class, you will be able to:

Describe a neural network model and its components.
Preprocess data for neural network models.
Implement neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Save trained TensorFlow neural network models for later use.
Compare neural network models and deep neural network models.
Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Apply encoding techniques to categorical variables.
Build deep neural network models for binary and multi-class problems.


# Social Project Funding

You work as an advisor and counselor at Neural Networks for the Social Good, a fictitious non-profit organization that funds social projects where neural networks can be applied. The Projects Assessment Team of Neural Networks for the Social Good receives many funding applications from non-governmental and non-profit organizations every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Neural Networks for the Social Good.

The Projects Assessment Team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each applicant, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful social project.
